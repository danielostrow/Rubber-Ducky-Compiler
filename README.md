# Rubber-Ducky-Compiler
Compiler for the Hak5 rubber ducky

I reverse engineered the Hak5 produced binary `inject.bin`

and built this simple python script to compile rubber ducky scripts into executable binary for use on the Rubber Ducky hardware.

Either change the variables to take arguments, or just call your script to be compiled `inject.txt`... Enjoy
